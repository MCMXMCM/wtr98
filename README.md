# Weather98

Check the weather in style like it's 1998

What if the weather channel released an win98 application ... this is what could have been

Uses:

- 98.css for styling https://github.com/jdan/98.css
- music and icons from https://twcclassics.com/
- api.weather.gov for weather data

handy little command to get base64 to clipboard for newly added images

openssl base64 < PM\ Partly\ Cloudy.gif | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy

to then add them to the base64 image list for display over the svg map... until i figure out a better way..
